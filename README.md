I'm Ever, I'm 26 and I work as a data analyst at a consulting company. Here I have scattered projects I've done throughout the years, don't be to hard. I'm a Chemical Engineer by training and I'm looking to improve as a programmer because... well i kinda like it. 

I know SQL and Python. Some C, barebones of Rust but honestly haven't built anything with it.
